markdown: Process markdown documents
====================================

This package contains a library to process
[markdown documents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
and translate such documents into HTML or LaTeX.
Furthermore, it also provides a stand-alone application
(executable `md2pdf`) for such translations.

The slightly restricted subset of the markdown syntax recognized by
this implementation is
[documented in this page](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/markdown_
syntax.html).
